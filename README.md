Default behavior:
- insivible for the first 48 hours 
- then a countdown is initiated
- each countdown sequence is stored in a cookie

It's useful for product launches, sales pages, ecommerce etc. Basically where you want to invoke scarcity, but not right away. 

Note:
- remove lines with an 'alert', this is just to tell you that something is actually happening (as the script doesn't show anything on first start/first 48hours)
